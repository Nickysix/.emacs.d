Subject: GNU Hyperbole 7.0.3: link your world quickly and easily
--text follows this line--
========================================================================
* Introduction
========================================================================

GNU Hyperbole 7.0.3 is released and ready for action.

Hyperbole is an amazing hypertextual information management system
that installs quickly and easily as an Emacs package.  It is part of
GNU Elpa, the Emacs Lisp Package Archive.

Hyperbole interlinks all your working information within Emacs for
fast access and editing, not just within special modes.  An hour
invested exploring Hyperbole's built-in interactive DEMO file will
save you hundreds of hours in your future work.

7.0.3 is a significant release with a number of interesting
improvements.  What's new in this release is described here:

   www.gnu.org/s/hyperbole/HY-NEWS.html

Hyperbole is described here:

   www.gnu.org/s/hyperbole

For use cases, see:

   www.gnu.org/s/hyperbole/HY-WHY.html

For what users think about Hyperbole, see:

Hyperbole can supplement and extend Org-mode's capabilities.  It adds
many features not found elsewhere in Emacs, including Org mode, see:

   www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole

Hyperbole includes its own easy-to-use hypertextual buttons and links
that can be created without the need for any markup language.

Hyperbole has an interactive demo to introduce you to its features as
well as a detailed reference manual, as explained here:

  https://www.gnu.org/s/hyperbole/hyperbole.html#invocation-and-doc

========================================================================
* Quick Reasons to Try Hyperbole
========================================================================

It contains:

- the most flexible and easy-to-use hyperbuttons available, including
  implicit buttons automatically recognized by context, e.g. stack
  trace source line references.

- the only Emacs outliner with full legal item numbering,
  e.g. 1.4.2.6, and automatic permanent hyperlink anchors for every
  item

- the only free-form contact manager with full-text search for Emacs

- rapid and precise window, frame and buffer placement on screen

- an extensive menu of typed web searches, e.g. dictionary, wikipedia
  and stackoverflow, plus convenient, fast file and line finding
  functions

- immediate execution of a series of key presses just by typing them
  out.  For example, a M-RETURN press on: {C-x C-b C-s scratch RET
  C-a} will find the first buffer menu item that contains 'scratch';
  then leave point at the beginning of its line.  Build interactive
  tutorials with this.


========================================================================
* The Magic of Implicit Buttons and the Action Key
========================================================================

For near instant gratification, try Hyperbole's 'implicit button'
capabilities (hyper-buttons that Hyperbole gives you for free by
recognizing all types of references embedded within text such as
pathnames or error message lines).  Below are more complex examples to
show the power; simpler ones can be found within the Hyperbole DEMO
file.

Implicit buttons are activated by pressing the Action Key, M-RETURN.
Once Hyperbole is loaded in your Emacs, pressing M-RETURN on any of
these examples *in virtually any buffer* will display the associated
referent in a chosen window or frame, handling all variable
substitution and full path resolution:

    "find-func.el"                            Find this file whether gzipped or not
                                              in the Emacs Lisp load-path

    "${hyperb:dir}/HY-NEWS"                   Resolve variable, show Hyperbole news

    "${PATH}/umask"                           Display a script somewhere in multi-dir PATH

    "${hyperb:dir}/DEMO#Hyperbole Menus"      Org mode outline, Markdown, and HTML # refs

    "(hyperbole)Menus"                        Texinfo and Info node links

    "c:/Users", "c:\Users", "/C/Users", "/c/Users", and "/mnt/c/Users"
                                            On Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux,
                                            Hyperbole recognizes all of these as the
                                            same path and can translate between Windows
                                            and POSIX path formats in both directions

Git Links:
    git#branches                              List branches in current repo/project
    git#commits                               List and browse commits for current project
    git#tags                                  List tags in current project

    git#/hyperbole                            From any buffer, dired on the top
                                              directory of the local hyperbole
                                              project

    git#/hyperbole/55a1f0 or                  From any buffer, display hyperbole
    git#hyperbole/55a1f0                      local git commit diff

    fb#technology                             Display facebook hashtag matches

Hyperbole uses simple prefix characters with paths to make them executable:
    "!/bin/date"                              Execute as a non-windowed program within a shell
    "&/opt/X11/bin/xeyes"                     Execute as a windowed program;
    "-find-func.el"                           Load/execute this Emacs Lisp library

    File "/usr/lib/python3.7/ast.py", line 37, in parse
                                              Jump to error/stack trace source

    "/ftp:anonymous@ftp.gnu.org:"             Tramp remote paths


========================================================================
* Try It - Installs or Uninstalls in a Minute
========================================================================

Hyperbole lets you concentrate more on your work.  Then as you grow
with it across time, it helps speed your work across weeks and months.
It installs in about a minute and can be uninstalled even faster if
ever need be.  Give it a try.

Hyperbole can boost your day-to-day productivity with Emacs and
your ability to manage information stored across many different
machines on the internet.

Hyperbole can be installed like any other package with the Emacs
package manager:

   {M-x list-packages RET C-s hyperbole RET i x y}

Then to invoke its menu:

   {C-h h} or {M-x hyperbole RET}

The best way to get a feel for many of its capabilities is to
invoke the interactive DEMO and explore sections of interest:

   {C-h h d d}

Enjoy,

7.0.2 Announcement
----------------------------------------------------------------------
From: Bob Weiner <rsw@gnu.org>
To: info-gnu@gnu.org, hyperbole-users@gnu.org, emacs-devel@gnu.org, gnu-emacs-sources@gnu.org, emacs-tangents@gnu.org
Subject: GNU Hyperbole 7.0.1-7.0.2 is now available
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2017
--text follows this line--
This is a minor release with a number of small issues resolved and the following
new features:

  SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - Keyboard Drags: Keyboard emulation of many Smart Mouse Key drag actions.
      See "(hyperbole)Keyboard Drags".
  
    - Keyboard Help: When {M-o} is bound to the `hkey-operate' command to
      emulate drag depress and release events, then when in the release window
      prior to pressing the second {M-o}, {C-h A} now reports the drag
      action associated with the current release point.  See "(hyperbole)C-h A".

    - Ace Window: Integrated Hyperbole item drag and link creation with this
      package's direct window selection.  Use {M-o i <window-id>}.
      You typically can display any Dired or Buffer Menu item in any window
      with a single 3 keystroke command!

      Also added the ability to 'throw' an item to a window while leaving the
      selected window the same.  Use {M-o t <window-id>}.  This
      works in Dired, Buffer Menu, iBuffer Menu and Treemacs modes and lets
      you throw multiple items to multiple windows quickly.

      See "(hyperbole)Keyboard Drags" for setup and use instructions.

    - Smart Treemacs: Smart Key and item drag support for the Treemacs package.
      See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Treemacs".

  HYROLO

    - Fixed Google Contacts support to prompt for authorization only during
      first time use.

GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole,
is an amazing, programmable hypertextual information management
system implemented as a GNU Emacs package and extensively
documented.  Hyperbole has been greatly expanded and updated for
use with the latest Emacs 26 releases; it supports GNU Emacs 24.4
or above.

Hyperbole can boost your day-to-day productivity with Emacs and
your ability to manage information stored across many different
machines on the internet.  People who get used to Hyperbole often
find they prefer never to use Emacs without it.

Hyperbole includes its own easy-to-use hypertextual buttons and
links that can be created without the need for any markup language.

It also comes out-of-the-box with:

  - a hierarchical, record-based contact manager

  - a rapid window and frame control system

  - a powerful multi-level auto-numbered outliner

  - and two very smart context-dependent mouse and keyboard keys
    that simplify operations in many editing and browsing modes.
    All features are aimed at making textual information management
    and display fast and easy.

Bob Weiner designed and programmed GNU Hyperbole.  He and Mats
Lidell maintain it with the Free Software Foundation.  It includes
an interactive demo to introduce you to its features as well as a
detailed reference manual, as explained here:

Please give Hyperbole a try.  It's free, man.  It adapts to your
needs. It connects everything.  It rewires your brain.  It speeds
your web searches for `carpal tunnel syndrome'.  It makes you feel
like the sun is out on a gray winter day :-)

But wait, there's more and this part is serious.  For a limited
time, to encourage use and feedback, the first 30 people who try
out the Hyperbole DEMO or read the Hyperbole Manual and send a few
thoughtful sentences to <rsw at gnu dot org> will receive either of
their choice of the following as yet unpublished single file Emacs
Lisp libraries:

;;  rsw-linecol.el: User-editable mode-line col/line number formats
;;
;;  GNU Emacs buries the formatting of mode-line line and column
;;  numbers in a way that makes it virtually impossible for a user
;;  to change this formatting.  This library fixes that with a new
;;  variable which may be modified to instantly alter the mode-line
;;  column and line number display.

or

;;  rsw-chrome-macos.el: Open a URL in Google Chrome and reuse an
;;     existing tab/window if already displayed.
;;
;;  This library resolves the many problems of sending URLs to
;;  Google Chrome on MacOS.  It properly sends # hash in-file links
;;  (these are typically stripped when Chrome is called as a MacOS
;;  application).  It reuses any tab already displaying any
;;  matching URL that is sent and it does this even if the
;;  ultimately displayed URL goes through several redirects before
;;  display.

Enjoy,

Bob Weiner and Mats Lidell
