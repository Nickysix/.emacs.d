	Merge tag 'hyperbole-7.0.2a' into externals/hyperbole

2018-06-06  Mats Lidell	 <mats.lidell@cag.se>

	Adjust tramp-file-name-regexp to work with looking-at

	Recent updates to tramp have introduced an ending match of empty string
	that does not work together with looking-at as used in hpath.

	A promising alternative to this change would be to use file-remote-p in
	combination with a regexp that finds a possible filename after point.
	This would remove the dependency on the internal regexp in tramp.

2018-05-20  Mats Lidell	 <mats.lidell@cag.se>

	Add default search term for web searches

	When region is active and not to big the selected text is used as a

	2017-12-20  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html-file-klink)
			 (kexport:html):

	   references since these must start with a letter.

	* hui-select.el (hui-select-get-region): Added this to be used in other
	libraries.
		       (hui-select-get-region-boundaries): Added and used in

	   gh#gh-34 and gh#issue/34 (needed to be plural).

2017-12-17  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Removed Koutliner use of filladapt mode; it can cause filling errors

	skip-chars-forward.

	2017-12-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	buffer-local-value.

2017-12-15  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Fixed hkey-throw temporary display of a buffer in a new frame

2017-12-14  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Fixed a cyclic Lisp library require; improved multi-frame hkey-throw

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Partially solved temporary display of
	newly created frames (when not given focus
	   initially with a '(no-focus-on-map . t) property), so hkey-throw to a
	new target frame now temporarily displays
	   the target frame and then makes the start frame the uppermost frame. 
	When on an item though, the item is
	   not visible during the temporary display yet.

	* Makefile (texinfo): Added texinfo dependency target and added
	additional image dependencies in man/im.

	* hyperbole.el (require 'hmouse-drv): Changed from hmouse-key to prevent
	a require cycle during macro expansion.
	   hmouse-key.el: Changed requires to just be during compile since
	hyperbole.el now includes these requires and
	     will load hmouse-key.

2017-12-12  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	7.0.2a test update:

	   company completion support; ripgrep match handling;
	  directional movement of buffers across windows;
	  hkey-{drag, replace, swap, throw} commands integrated
	    with ace-window;
	  hmouse-click commands to perform cross-window drags,
	    replacements and throws with 3 mouse clicks;

	* hversion.el: Pushed 7.0.2a test update.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Modified to show a message if the frame of
	release is
	   different than the frame of depress, since this frame is typically
	hidden by
	   the depress frame.

	* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-mode-p): Added change-log-mode since such
	files often contain
	   Lisp references.

	* hypb.el (hypb:select-window-frame): Added and used in
	hmouse-item-to-window.
		 (hypb:save-selected-window-and-input-focus): Added and used in
	hkey-throw.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Menu Commands, HyRolo Menu): Documented how to
	invoke the Koutliner and
	   HyRolo popup menus in Emacs.

	* hyrolo-menu.el (hyrolo-menubar-menu):
	 kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu): For GNU Emacs, use standard binding
	of C-mouse-3 to popup
	   mode-specific menu instead of mouse-3.

	2017-12-08  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Autoloaded since might be added
	to an init file
	   before Hyperbole is loaded.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-quit-frames-mode,
	hycontrol-quit-windows-mode): Added conditionals
	   to allow for quitting from help buffers with {q} while remaining in
	HyControl, e.g. if
	   display a key binding help window.  Added {Q} binding to
	unconditionally quit from HyControl.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-buffer-move): Added directional movement commands
	that call this function.
	   hkey-buffer-move-left, hkey-buffer-move-right, hkey-buffer-move-down
	and hkey-buffer-move-up.

	2017-12-07  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hload-path.el (hyperb:emacs-p): Removed Emacs19 test.
		       (hyperb:kotl-p): Removed since all versions of Emacs in
	use now support the Koutliner.

	* hlvar.el - Removed this since colons are now handled by Emacs 26 in
	local variable names.

	* hypb.el (hypb:rgrep): Added support for ripgrep.
	 hibtypes.el (ripgrep-msg): Added implicit button support for ripgrep
	(rg) messages where

	   See "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep".

	2017-12-04  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-alist): Reload the def of this variable if its
	value is null.
	   (hkey-mouse-click-to-replace): Added to allow moving buffers with the
	mouse by clicking
	      on the from and to windows.
	   (hmouse-click-to-drag, hmouse-click-to-drag-to,
	hmouse-click-to-replace, hmouse-click-to-throw,
	    hmouse-choose-windows): Added to perform cross-window drags,
	replacements and throws with 3 mouse
	      clicks.

	2017-12-03  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-treemacs.el: Removed replacements for treemacs functions; as of
	Treemacs 1.14, all needed changes are
	   included.

	2017-12-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-drag-stay, hkey-replace): Added for use as
	ace-window commands.
		       (hkey-throw): Rewrote so if not on an item, then throws
	the current buffer.
	   hkey-replace is the inverse, it grabs the specified buffer and places
	it into the selected
	   window ({p} command key for ace-window).  hkey-drag-stay does a drag
	but leaves point
	   in the originally selected window.
		       (hmouse-click-to-drag, hmouse-click-to-drag-stay,
	hmouse-click-to-drag-to)
			hmouse-click-to-replace, hmouse-click-to-swap,
	hmouse-click-to-throw): Added to click
	   with the mouse twice on two different windows to select the windows
	using hmouse-choose-windows.
		       (hkey-drag, hkey-drag-stay, hkey-drag-to, hkey-replace,
	hkey-swap, hkey-throw): Added and
	   made interactive with ace-window window parameter selection.
		       (hkey-buffer-to): Added to copy a buffer from-window
	to-window, using ace-window
	   to select the windows.
		       (hkey-swap-buffers): Added to swap buffers between
	from-window and to-window, using ace-window
	   to select the windows.

	* hui-treemacs.el (smart-treemacs): Added standard Hyperbole end-of-line
	scrolling support.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-company-to-definition, smart-company-help): Added
	to support company completion mode.
	 hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-shifted-setup, hmouse-unshifted-setup): Added
	Action and Assist Key local bindings
	   for company-mode for GNU Emacs.

	2017-11-30  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added Jedi item with link to its home
	page.  Added link to the OO-Browser
	   home page in its item.

	* hmouse-tag.el (smart-python-jedi-to-definition-p): Added and called in
	smart-python to use the Jedi
	   package when its server is running.	It jumps to the proper
	definition of multi-level module
	   references definitions, e.g. a.b.c.	Also fixed error where the
	default action was not jumping to
	   a tag definition at point because it was testing that the identifier
	parameter was non-nil (no
	   identifier is sent in such usage).

	* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Moved smart-python prior to Imenu for more
	advanced definition lookups

	* hyperbole.el (temp-buffer-show-hook, temp-buffer-show-function): Added
	Hyperbole hkey-help-show
	   function rather than replacing any existing hook values.

	2017-11-29  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hibtypes.el (markdown-internal-link): Rewrote (and added support
	functions) to handle markdown
	   infile links properly.  Previous use of markdown-do was removed
	because that now does things
	   other than following links.

	2017-11-28  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Added conditionals to support org-mode
	org-goto *Org Help* buffer
	   properly.

	2017-11-27  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Made new ace-window frames
	(window id = z) inherit the size
	   of the prior selected frame; same as HyWindow.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region, hmouse-yank-region): Added
	select-frame-set-input-focus
	   in case released in a different frame.

	2017-11-26  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Restored input focus to start-win rather
	than just making it
	   the selected window.
		       (hkey-drag-to): Fixed predicate test to call
	hmouse-at-item-p instead of
	   hmouse-drag-item-to-display and set input focus to release-window if
	dragging an item.

2017-12-06  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Drop support for (X)Emacs-19

	* hload-path.el (hyperb:emacs-p): Remove.  When used as a boolean, 
	equivalent to (not (featurep 'xemacs)), so replace all uses with it.
	(hyperb:kotl-p): Remove.  Always non-nil, so replace with t.

	* hlvar.el (hack-local-variables): Assume emacs-version is not 19.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-get-bindings, hmouse-get-unshifted-bindings): 
	Avoid unneeded use of `eval'.
	(hmouse-shifted-setup, hmouse-unshifted-setup): Remove dead code.

	* hyperbole.el (hkey-set-bindings): Use dolist.

2017-11-26  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Delete hkey-ace-window-setup bindings before rebinding; fixed hkey-throw
	split line typo and hycontrol-frame-offset typo

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Added deletion of i and t
	command bindings before
	   adding them to aw-dispatch-alist.
		       (hkey-throw): Fixed split line code typo here.
	 hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-offset): Fixed typo.

2017-11-23  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-at-item-p): Added to test if on a draggable
	item.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Added to throw a drag item to a specific
	window via the
	   ace-window package and the key sequence {M-o t <window-id>}, leaving
	the original
	   source window selected.
	* man/hyperbole.texi (Keyboard Drags): Added description of throwing an
	item.

	* hui-mouse.el: Fixed a compilation time problem with when hmouse-alist

	into externals/hyperbole

2017-11-22  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Fixed small issues in error reporting and released version 7.0.1

	* hversion.el: Released 7.0.1.

	* hui.el (hui:buf-writable-err): Added previously unused func-name
	parameter to error msg.

	* hypb.el (hypb:error): Fixed issue when a literal string with %
	characters in it was sent to format
	   and triggered an error, e.g. when a buffer or file name contains a %.

2017-11-22  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Fixed issue where Hyperbole improperly bound {q} for quit in
	with-temp-buffer buffers.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Limited local binding of {q} to
	hkey-help-hide only
	   when in a help-mode (or derived) buffer.

2017-11-21  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Documented latest changes and allowed for small movements in Smart Mouse
	Key modeline clicks

	* hversion.el: Updated to 7.0.1 for release.

	* DEMO (Displaying File and Buffer Items): Added description of
	ace-window integration.

	* HY-WHY.kotl: Added link to Delimited Thing drags; mention of Treemacs

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Treemacs): Added and updated with
	other improvements for this release.
			    (Keyboard Drags): Added this section and documented
	integration with ace-window package.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-modeline-click): Loosened check to allow a small
	movement between press and release
	   as long as it is less than whatever amount of movement registers a
	drag (used to require exact pixel match).

2017-11-21  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Keyboard drags; Treemacs item drags; Ace-Window item throws and HyRolo
	Google Contacts improvements

	Enabled keyboard-based drag emulation and associated help with {C-h A}. 
	Made HyRolo support of Google Contacts usable by eliminating repeated
	login requests. Added item drags for Treemacs file viewer package. Added
	{i} key to Ace-Window package operations to display an item in a
	specific window.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Setup keyboard-based display of
	items in windows specified by
	   short ids.  See its doc string for how to use.
		       (hkey-drag, hkey-drag-jump): Added for mouse drag
	emulation via keyboard from a single
	   function that uses the selected window point for depress location and
	the parameter RELEASE-WINDOW
	   for the window and its point for release.  hkey-drag-jump is useful
	as a command in the ace-window
	   package's aw-dispatch-alist, e.g. {i} for insert item, because it
	leaves RELEASE-WINDOW selected.

	* hui-select.el (hui-select-ignore-quoted-sexp-modes): Added so major
	modes to ignore for syntactic pair
	   selection can be customized.
		       (hui-select-at-delimited-thing-p): Changed to not trigger
	when on an Emacs button.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-between-frames): Replaced calls to
	window-valid-p with window-live-p.

	hmouse-drag-same-window,
		 hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows, hmouse-drag-item-to-display,
		 hmouse-item-to-window): Added window-live-p checks for cases
	where a window has
	   been deleted between depress and release.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Updated to
	support keyboard drag emulation.
		       (hkey-help): Changed hkey-forms to use hmouse-alist
	instead of hkey-alist so mouse
	   drags are accounted for when emulating drags from the keyboard and
	then invoking {C-h A} for help.
	 hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows): Triggered only if an
	action/assist-key press has
	   occurred, e.g. could be called by hkey-help when no press has
	occurred.
		       (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Removed error when
	there is no valid coordinate and
	   returned nil instead to support keyboard drag emulation help.

	2017-11-20  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-absolute-pixel-position): Added and used in
	Action/Assist Key functions.
		       (hmouse-set-point): Fixed hkey-operate bug by wrapping
	final (posn-at-point) in
	   a list with an event type symbol so if called from a keyboard event,
	returns a proper format
	   event.
		       (hkey-operate): Changed so output messages only when
	called interactively.

	* hui-treemacs.el: Added for Smart Key support of the Treemacs file
	manager.
			  (smart-treemacs): Added.
			  (smart-treemacs-modeline): Added to allow toggling of
	Treemacs display on
	   Action Key clicks on buffer id of modeline.
	 hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist, action-key-modeline-buffer-id-function):
	Added Smart Key treemacs
	   package support.
	 hui-window.el (action-key-modeline): Updated to call
	action-key-modeline-buffer-id-function.
	 hactypes.el (link-to-buffer-tmp): Added optional 2nd parameter of POINT
	to display.

	2017-11-19  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-item-to-window): Added support for
	hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms sending
	   a sequence of (buffer position) rather than just buffer.
		       (hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms): Added support for dragging
	items from the treemacs
	   hierachical file viewer package.

	2017-11-17  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-initialize-file-list): Fixed to set
	hyrolo-file-list.
		   (hyrolo-retrieve-google-contacts): Updated to cache Google
	passphrase whenever Google contacts
	   are used so the user is not prompted for his passphrase on every
	HyRolo search.
	 man/hyperbole.texi (HyRolo Settings): Updated Google Contacts settings
	handling to document this caching.

	* man/im/C-hh.png - Added showing Hyperbole mini-buffer menu prefix key
	binding.

	2017-11-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hywconfig.el (hywconfig-delete-pop): Fixed bug that removed the ring
	entry before using it to restore
	   the window configuration.

2017-11-15  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Fixed a bunch of small issues and released Hyperbole 7.

	* hversion.el: Updated to 7.0.0 for major release.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-window-side): Fixed coordinate error when
	drag release is outside of Emacs.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-assist): Fixed message formatting bugs in
	hkey-debug message.

	* hlvar.el (hack-local-variables): Changed from use of older
	inhibit-local-variables variable to newer
	   (inhibit-local-variables-p) function call.

	* Makefile (version): Removed HY-ANNOUNCE-SHORT from distribution.

	* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html): Changed to wrap cell contents in
	<PRE></PRE> tags if soft-newline-flag is nil
	   rather than using <BR> hard newlines, so all cell formatting is
	preserved.  Also changed NAME attribute to
	   ID for HTML5.

	2017-11-14  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* kotl/kimport.el (kimport:star-heading): Added and replaced use of
	hard-coded regexps in star outline importation.
	   Also, stopped allowing leading whitespace before outline heading
	stars so can use indented stars as list items
	   rather than outline headings.

	* hibtypes.el (text-toc): Expanded file names to include DEMO and
	TUTORIAL.
	 DEMO: Added Table of Contents and a section on using it, Table of
	Contents Browsing.

	* hbut.el (ebut:label-p): Changed last parameter to limit search to two

	5px from code samples so display inline better.

2017-11-14  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Highlighted explicit buttons when yanked; fixed region location bugs
	with hmouse-drag-thing and region kill, copy and yank

	2017-11-13  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-thing): Added error if drag ends within the
	delimited thing region, so user knows
	   that this is an invalid drag.
		       (hmouse-yank-region, hmouse-kill-and-yank-region): Made
	no-op unless hkey-region is non-nil.
	   This handles the hmouse-drag-thing case when we want that predicate
	true (so no other predicate matches)
	   but there is no region to copy or kill, e.g. when the release point
	is within the thing itself.

	* hui-select.el (hui-select-delimited-thing): Fixed to match doc and
	work as a predicate.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point): Deleted since it
	duplicated hmouse-goto-region-prev-point.
		       (hmouse-goto-region-prev-point): Added missing check for
	prev-point nil when setting loc.
	   This caused the Smart Keys to fail when used if a Lisp backtrace was
	active.
		       (hmouse-drag-thing): Erased any saved location of a
	region prior to Smart Key depress since
	   now we have a new region location.  This prevents
	hmouse-kill-and-yank-region from jumping to the old
	   location.  Also fixed edge cases where want to copy or move thing to
	the beginning or end of the thing region.
		       (hmouse-goto-region-point): Renamed to
	hmouse-goto-region-prev-point, for clarity.
		       (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region, hmouse-kill-region): Used
	value of point saved in hkey-value to determine
	   the region if non-nil.

	* hui-select.el (hui-select-delimited-thing, hui-select-thing): Changed
	to use use-region-p.
	 hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-use-region-p): Added and used to improve
	hmouse-drag-thing.
		       (hmouse-save-region): Simplified.
	 hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-region-active): Changed call of
	region-active-p to hmouse-use-region-p.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region): Fixed error that was
	testing not in depress buffer (as desired) but the
	   buffer prior to depress.  Also protected insertion from
	syntax-directed indentation errors.

	* hui-em-but.el
	 hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:but-create-on-yank): Added as handler for
	yank-handled-properties so explicit buttons are
	   re-highlighted when yanked after being killed.

2017-11-09  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Minor doc and code improvements

2017-11-09  Mats Lidell	 <mats.lidell@cag.se>

	Correct spelling

2017-11-09  Mats Lidell	 <mats.lidell@cag.se>

	Use replace-regexp-in-string instead of replace-in-string

2017-11-06  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Many bug fixes; added HyRolo DEMO section; many Hyperbole Manual updates
	including images

	* hyrolo-demo.el (hyrolo-demo-quit): Added to unload hyrolo-demo code
	and used in demo.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus): Documented hyperbole-popup-menu.

	* hui-menu.el (hyperbole-popup-menu): With a non-nil prefix arg, rebuild
	the Hyperbole popup menu in case it did
	   not initialize properly for any reason.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Using URLs with Find-File): Added URL browser
	customization menu reference and image.
			    (Smart Key - WWW URLs): Added
	browse-url-browser-function and Cust/URL-Display reference.
		     (Referent Display): Added this section and documented
	display options for standard link referents.

	* hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic): Removed improper outline test for
	old format Emacs outlines.
			 (hyrolo-fgrep-logical): Fixed to include sub-entries in
	logical searches.

	* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:mark-spaces-to-keep): Added to preserve spaces in
	(), [], or <> delimited sections of
	   Hyperbole sequences of brace delimited keys; used this function in
	kbd-key:normalize.

	2017-11-04  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid-buffer-list): Replaced all uses
	of (eq major-mode 'dired-mode) with
	   (derived-mode-p 'dired-mode) to generalize.

	2017-11-03  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (HyRolo Settings): Added Google Contacts set up and
	use description.

	* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-file-list-initialize): Made interactive and
	displayed a message with the resulting list
	   if called interactively.  Added autoload.
		   (hyrolo-initialize-file-list): Renamed from
	hyrolo-file-list-initialize.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-split-window): Changed to split selected window
	parallel to its shortest dimension.

	* DEMO: Added new section on HyRolo.
	 DEMO-ROLO.otl: Added.
	 hyrolo-demo.el: Added with the functions hyrolo-demo-fgrep and
	hyrolo-demo-fgrep-logical.
	 hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic): Fixed issue where a buffer was
	required but a buffer name was
	   given as an argument preventing search from matching.
			 (hyrolo-fgrep-logical): Fixed that logical searches
	were not forced to case insensitive
	   to match hyrolo-fgrep.  Also updated to handle non-logical string
	searches.

	* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Fixed issue where user had selected a region
	to use as a button label but then
	   the same text was inserted when the label was created.  Solved by
	moving point to the beginning of
	   any marked region so buffer text comparison succeeds.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Simplified logic in
	GNU Emacs clause.
		       (hmouse-emacs-modeline-event-p): If a drag release was to
	an unselected frame mode-line,
	   on click-to-focus systems, the release event will not include the
	mode-line area when release was on
	   the mode-line, so manually compute if that was the location.

	2017-11-02  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Fixed that arguments were being stripped
	from action calls in the help
	   output.

	* hibtypes.el (pathname): Fixed to handle "-subr.elc" whose prefix
	character "-" tells Hyperbole
	   to load, not display subr.elc.  Also handled subr.el.gz compressed
	source files.

	* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Prevented matches to brace delimited things that
	are not preceded by
	   whitespace or at the beginning of buffers, e.g. ${variable}.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Added examples.
	 hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Improved doc.

	* hibtypes.el (hyp-address): Fixed to grab email address using
	thing-at-point and work in mail-mode
	   not just whatever mode hmail:composer is.
		     (Info-node): Added check for ``dual single quotes'' used in
	Texinfo smart quotes.

	* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-value):
		  (hpath:substitute-dir): Fixed to handle unbound symbol names. 
	This fixed an error when an
	   environment variable matched a symbol but the symbol was unbound,
	e.g. (hpath:substitute-value
	   "${PATH}/python")

2017-11-02  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added additional Hyperbole Manual section changes.

2017-11-02  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Button Colors): Added doc on
	hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
			    (Hook Variables): Added doc of:
	action-key-depress-hook, action-key-release-hook,
	   assist-key-depress-hook and assist-key-release-hook.

	* hsettings.el (hproperty:but-highlight-flag): Added as a setting.
	 hui-em-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Renamed to
	hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
		       (hproperty:but-emphasize-p): Renamed to
	hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
	 hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Renamed to
	hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
		       (hproperty:but-emphasize-p): Renamed to
	hproperty:but-highlight-flag.

2017-11-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Fixed predicate test in kbd-key:key-and-arguments.

2017-11-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Corrected mouse-position and mouse-pixel-position to return selected
	frame; added key sequences with args support.

	* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:special-sequence-p): Added and used in implicit
	button type kbd-key and kbd-key:act.
		    (kbd-key:key-and-arguments): Added to allow for key
	sequences with interactive arguments and
	   added an example in DEMO.

	* hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
	 hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Added Find Web and Jump Thing key
	binding change entries.

	* hyperbole.el (mouse-position-function): Added this setting to make
	mouse-position and mouse-pixel-position
	   always return the selected frame.

	* hsettings.el (helm-allow-mouse): Changed to require Hyperbole-modified
	branch of Helm named global_mouse
	   and set helm-allow-mouse to the proper value of
	'global-mouse-bindings.

2017-11-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Prep and bug fixes for next major release; fixed Smart Mouse Key point
	location issue; renamed to kotl/kotl-autoloads.el

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2g and rebuilt output
	formats.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-prior-active-region): Changed to call
	use-region-p rather than active-region-p, for a tighter test.
	   This is used as a predicate; fixed bug that moved point, causing
	Smart Key release logic to use the wrong point.

	* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-add-unshifted-smart-keys): Removed GNU
	Emacs-only dependencies.

	* kotl/kotl-autoloads.el: Renamed from kotl/kotl-loaddefs.el to match
	package autoload naming scheme.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-unshifted-setup): In Info-mode, Emacs uses
	key-translation-map to link mouse-1 to do whatever
	   mouse-2 does but because Hyperbole uses both down and up bindings on
	mouse2, this does not work.  So we rebind
	   mouse-1 and double-mouse-1 in Info mode to be actual Action Mouse
	Keys (which makes them follow Info
	   links/cross-references properly, doing a superset of what they did
	before).
		      (hmouse-posn-set-point): Added to handle frames rather
	than windows returned by some events; used in
	   hmouse-move-point-emacs.

	* hui-mouse.el (hmouse-tag): Added require of hmouse-info and hmouse-tag
	for smart-info, smart-lisp etc. when autoload
	   file is not available.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-bind-key-emacs):
	 hui-select.el (hui-select-initialize): Added missing double-down-* and
	triple-down-* bindings.

	2017-10-31  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Added an "Initializing Hyperbole..."
	message at the beginning of this function.
	   Removed 'Hyperbole loading' message at the beginning of this file
	since Emacs load function outputs a similar
	   message.  Moved Hyperbole 'ready for action' message here rather than
	at the end of this file since Hyperbole
	   initialization may be deferred until after Emacs initializaton time. 
	Hyperbole init. is complete only after
	   this function is run.

	2017-10-30  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Removed mention of old remote file
	access packages: ange-ftp and EFS.  Use Tramp only
	   now.
			    (Searching and Summarizing): Renamed from Location.

	* hpath.el (hpath:remote-at-p): Fixed to return /ftp: pre-pended to ftp
	paths since Tramp requires it.

	* hibtypes.el (mail-address): Made lower priority than pathname so when
	an email-like user@domain is part of a remote
	   pathname, this won't trigger.

	* hpath.el (hpath:rfc): Prepended /ftp: to value so tramp recognizes it
	as a remote file path.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Key Modifiers):
	 hmouse-mod.el: Disabled this feature since it conflicts with present
	Emacs bindings of Control- and Meta- mouse keys.

	* hui-mini.el (Doc/Manifest):
	 hui-menu.el (Documentation/Manifest): Changed to use
	hypb:display-file-with-logo so can quit after viewing.

	* hversion.el (id-browse-file): Changed alias from find-file-read-only
	to view-file.
	 hui-mini.el (Doc/SmartKeys): Changed command used to match that used
	when same doc is displayed with a click at the right
	   of a modeline.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keys): Added section on Smart Mouse Key
	Drags to match those in the DEMO file.
			    (Global Key Bindings): Replaced hkey-toggle-bindings
	with proper reference to
	   hyperbole-toggle-bindings.
			    (Smart Key Bindings): Included
	hyperbole-toggle-bindings (toggles keyboard and mouse keys)
	   rather than hmouse-toggle-bindings (toggles only mouse keys); moved
	the latter to the Global Key Bindings appendix.

2017-10-27  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Action Mouse Key drag to modeline splits destination window before
	displaying the target item/buffer; added css to format Hyperbole HTML
	manual

	* man/hyperbole.css: Added to format HTML version of the Hyperbole
	manual like the Hyperbole web page, greatly improving
	   its appearance.

	* man/hkey-help.txt:
	 man/hyperbole.texi (Modeline Clicks and Drags):  Documented new drag
	below.
	 hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): Added context of a drag from a window
	with a release to a modeline which for Action Mouse
	   Key splits the release window (which contains the modeline) and then
	displays the item or the buffer from the depress
	   window in the release window.  With the Assist Mouse Key, just swaps
	buffers with no new window creation.

			(hmouse-modeline-click): Updated to do full testing for
	a click, so this can be called at any point
	   after Smart Mouse Key release.
		       (hmouse-buffer-to-window, hmouse-item-to-window): Added
	optional boolean new-window parameter to force
	   a new window before buffer display.
		       (hmouse-split-window): Added.
		(hmouse-modeline-event-p): Fixed conditional error that caused
	fall through past Modern GNU Emacs clause.
		(action-mouse-key, assist-mouse-key): Set above new variables.
		       (action-key, assist-key): Added clear of any value of
	*-key-depress/release-position.
	 hmouse-drv.el (action-key-release-position,
	assist-key-release-position): Added these to compare to existing
	   *-key-depress-position value.

	* README.md, HY-ANNOUNCE: Updated for public release.

	finalized DEMO and manual.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Drags outside a Window): Added this
	new section.
	   Updated manual with all new drag actions.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-goto-region-point, hmouse-prior-active-region):
	Rewrote these to work properly so that Smart
	   Mouse yanking and killing feature works as documented.  Previously,
	it was not switching to the buffer of the
	   depress point when checking foran active region.

	* hmouse-drv.el: Updated doc.

	* MANIFEST (topwin): Renamed to topwin.py.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid): Improved doc.

			    Wrapped all images with @example and removed @center
	so do not appear way to the left of text when
	   formatted as html.
			    (Koutliner): Centralized all key binding index
	entries under "koutliner, ".
		     (Glossary): Added Windows Grid entry.
		     (HyControl): Added Concept Index entries.
		     (Manual Overview): Improved pointer to DEMO.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid-rows-columns): Renamed to
	hycontrol-make-windows-grid.
		      (hycontrol--frames-prompt-format,
	hycontrol--windows-prompt-format): Changed FRAME: and WINDOW: prompt
	   to plural to match mode and variable names.

2017-10-25  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Renamed @ command functions to hycontrol-windows-grid.	Updated manual
	and DEMO with newest commands.

	* hycontrol.el: Extended initial commentary with new features and
	improved explanations.
		       (hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns): Modified to
	temporarily exit HyControl mode if need
	   to read a rows-columns argument.
		       (hycontrol-split-windows-buffer-list,
	hycontrol-split-windows, hycontrol-split-windows-by-major-mode
		       hycontrol-split-windows-repeatedly,
	hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns): Renamed by replacing
	   'split-windows' with 'windows-grid'.
		       (hycontrol-window-minimize-lines): Previously did not
	resize window if it could not display all of the
	   buffer lines in the window.	Now will resize to 1 line if cannor or
	if all lines are already displayed.
		       (hycontrol-split-windows-buffer-list): Added doc string.

	* DEMO (HyControl): Added interactive examples of newest HyControl
	commands.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point): Fixed to handle when
	no prev-point is saved.
		       (hmouse-drag-region-active): Return nil if no prev-point
	saved.

	* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Fixed to handle single % in path argument when
	sent as format string near the
	   end of the function.

	* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Quoted % characters as %% to prevent
	format from treating them specially.
		    (kbd-key:hyperbole-hycontrol-key-p): Added to match key
	sequences within HyControl since
	   its prefix arguments are specified without C-u or ESC or META
	prefixes.
		    (kbd-key, kbd-key:act): Used above function here.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-either): Fixed to ignore prefix args set by
	HyControl.

	* hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
	 hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Changed {C-c \} entry from

	Hyperbole 6.0.2f pre-release

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2f and rebuilt output
	formats.

2017-10-24  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/hyperbole with Mats
	assist-flag fix.

2017-10-24  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	HyControl changes: now a global minor mode; added @ window grid creation
	command; inverted selected mode-line for emphasis

	2017-10-24  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-universal-arg-digit): Removed first argument
	and replaced with global hycontrol-arg,
	   so could set this value internally.

		       (hycontrol--debug, hycontrol-setup): Changed from -1 to 0
	as debug setting since -1 is used to turn off
	   HyControl minor modes.
		      (hycontrol-debug): Renamed from hycontrol--debug.	 Made
	public so can be set directly.
		      (hycontrol-setup, hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): :
	Removed debug parameter; no longer needed since
	   all events are handled normally by Emacs now.

		       (hycontrol-windows-mode-map): [ and ] bindings; don't
	call these interactively because a prefix arg of 1
	   tries to make one window 1 line tall.

		       (hycontrol-split-windows-repeatedly): Added to allow
	rapid visual testing of various window layouts until
	   satisfied.

		       (hycontrol-post-command-hook): Made this automatically
	quit from HyControl whenever a minibuffer prompt
	   becomes active so can use regular keys to type.

		       (hycontrol-invert-mode-line-flag,
	hycontrol-invert-mode-line): Added to invert mode-line to emphasize the
	   special key bindings in effect in HyControl modes.

	2017-10-23  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-split-windows-buffer-list): Added to prefix
	buffer-list with any marked items
	   when in a Dired, Buffer-Menu or iBuffer listing buffer.  If any such
	items exist, the buffer-list
	   is not filtered by hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list.

		       (hycontrol-pre-command-hook): Added and changed setting
	of prefix-arg to pre-command-hook.  This set it
	   properly for HyControl commands.

		       (hycontrol--prompt-format): Added to generalize help
	prompt handling.
		      (hycontrol-post-command-hook): Replaced windows and frames
	post-command-hook with this one.

		       (hycontrol-frames-mode, hycontrol-windows-mode): Made
	these global minor modes and added their
	   variables to the hyperbole-screen group.  Buffer local minor modes
	renamed to hycontrol-local-*-mode.
		      (hycontrol-quit-frames-mode, hycontrol-quit-windows-mode):
	Changed defs to disable its global
	   minor mode.

		       (hycontrol-post-command-hook): Fixed so HyControl help
	messages are not logged to the
	   *Messages* buffer.

		       (hycontrol-disable-modes): Added.

	* set.el (set:create): Added autoload in case is ever used without a
	require.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-split-windows,
	hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns,
	hycontrol-split-windows-by-major-mode):
	   Incredible new autoloaded commands that split a frame into a number
	of balanced
	   windows specified by rows and columns (typically as prefix arg
	   digits).  Each window shows a different buffer, if possible, with the
	   by-major-mode command preferring buffers with the specified major
	mode.  The hycontrol-split-windows
	   chooses the by-major-mode command when given a prefix arge of 0;
	otheriwse, the rows-column one.
		      (hycontrol-window-display-buffer,
	hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list)
		       hycontrol--invert-display-buffer-predicates): Added to
	support new commands.
		      (require 'set): Added for set:create used in
	hycontrol-split-windows-by-major-mode.
		      (hycontrol-*-mode-map): Bound {@} to
	hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns, also in Buffer-menu,
	   IBuffer and Dired modes.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol--initial-which-key-inhibit): Added.
		      (hycontrol-end-mode, hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows):
	Used above flag.

		       (hycontrol-setup): Refactored common parts of
	hycontrol-frames and hycontrol-windows here.
	       (hycontrol-frames-setup, hycontrol-windows-setup): Added and used
	in
	   hycontrol-frames and hycontrol-windows, respectively.

	2017-10-22  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* Makefile ($(pkg_dir)/hyperbole-$(HYPB_VERSION).tar): Ensured `topwin'
	script was made executable.
	 hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Changed to
	find `topwin' executable in
	   hyperb:dir so no additional installation is necessary.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-to-new-frame): Fixed to duplicate prior
	selected window size properly.

	* hui-window.el
	 man/hkey-help.txt: Noted that a modeline click on a dired Buffer ID
	shows the parent directory.

	2017-10-20  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-help-flag):
		      (hycontrol-toggle-help): Added to allow toggling
	minibuffer key binding help off.
	       (hycontrol-frames-mode, hycontrol-windows-mode): Made HyControl
	modes into minor modes.
		      (hycontrol-enable-frames-mode,
	hycontrol-enable-windows-mode): Renamed from
	   hycontrol-toggle-to-*-mode.
	 man/hyperbole.texi (HyControl): Updated documentation with these
	changes.

	* hbut.el (ibtype:create): Expanded this doc for defact, explaining how
	actions are connected to its
	  'at-p' parameter.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-abort-mode): Added and used when {C-g} is
	pressed; exits HyControl
	   and executes (keyboard-quit).
		      (hycontrol-end-mode, hycontrol-quit-frames-mode,
	hycontrol-quit-windows-mode,
		       hycontrol-toggle-to-frames-mode,
	hycontrol-toggle-to-windows-mode): Added
	   and used as key bindings.
	   (hycontrol-exit-mode): Deleted and replaced with above commands.

	    (hycontrol-frame-fit-to-screen): Changed to adjust width and height
	separately which fixed
	     a bug in our call to set-frame-size which kept increasing the frame
	height slightly.

	    (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Prevented `which-key' package
	from popping up its key
	      help and interferring with the minibuffer message while in
	HyControl.  Otherwise, the
	      which-key help could be left onscreen after a quit of HyControl.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-pulse-flag): Made t the default because timing
	and display issues with
	   pulsing drag items were resolved now.

	2017-10-19  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (pkg): Changed hyperbole source dir from hyperbole-<version>
	to hyperbole since that
	   is the name of the git repo top-level directory from which packages
	are now built.

	* hui-jmenu.el (hui-menu-hywconfig): Fixed improper variable reference
	that kept Delete-Name
	   and Restore-Name from ever being active.

2017-10-24  Mats Lidell	 <matslidell@spotify.com>

	Add defvar for assist-flag

2017-10-19  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	V6.0.2e: Rewrote HyControl for improved generality, event handling and
	to support key bindings.

	2017-10-19  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2e and rebuilt output
	formats.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-adjust-widths,
	hycontrol-frame-adjust-heights,
	   hycontrol-frame-adjust-widths-full-height,
	hycontrol-frame-adjust-heights-full-width,
	   hycontrol-set-width-percentage-full-height,
	hycontrol-set-height-percentage-full-width,
	   hycontrol-frame-widths-pointer, hycontrol-frame-widths,
	hycontrol-frame-heights-pointer,
	   hycontrol-frame-heights: Added to cycle through resizing height or
	width of frames to
	     common sizes.  Also cycle through one dimension while fixing the
	other dimension
	     at full-screen size.
	   (hycontrol--frames-prompt-format): Added {a} and {A} bindings to both
	frames and windows
	       keymaps to adjust frame width and height respectively by cycle
	through a list of common
	       fixed percentages such as 25% and 50%.  Added to Hyperbole
	manual.

	    (hycontrol-frames-post-command-hook-body,
	hycontrol-windows-post-command-hook-body):
	     Added to prevent {C-g} quit from signalling an error within
	post-command-hook.

	2017-10-18  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-restore-frame-configuration,
	hycontrol-restore-window-configuration,
		       hycontrol-save-configurations,
	hycontrol-delete-other-frames,
		       hycontrol-delete-other-windows,
	hycontrol-clone-window-to-new-frame
		       hycontrol-make-frame): Made interactive.
		      (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Forced arg to
	numeric value on entry.
		       (hycontrol-stay-in-mode, hycontrol-universal-arg-digit,
		hycontrol--debug, hycontrol--exit-status, hycontrol-arg,
		hycontrol--frames-prompt-format,
	hycontrol--windows-prompt-format,
		hycontrol-frames-pre-command-hook,
	hycontrol-windows-pre-command-hook,
		hycontrol-frames-mode-map, hycontrol-windows-mode-map,
	hycontrol-exit-mode): Added.
	       (hycontrol-prettify-event, hycontrol-handle-event): Removed.

		       (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Rewrote HyControl
	to use a frame-mode
	  and window-mode transient keymap which allows for regular key bindings
	and eliminates
	  the need for a HyControl event loop and processing of non-HyControl
	events.	 There should
	  be no change in HyControl user-visible behavior from this other than
	that key bindings
	  may now be customized (remember to update the HyControl minibuffer
	prompts if you do change
	  any).

	2017-10-17  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-screen-offset-alist,
	hycontrol-set-screen-offsets,
		       hycontrol-display-screen-offsets):
	   Changed ordering of items to match Emacs window-edges and
	frame-edges.
		      (hycontrol-fit-to-screen): Added and used to ensure
	resized and repositioned
	   windows fit on the screen.
	   (hycontrol-set-frame-height, hycontrol-set-frame-position,
	hycontrol-set-frame-size,
	    hycontrol-set-frame-width): Added with calls to
	hycontrol-fit-to-screen.

	* man/hyperbole.texi: Removed InfoDock and XEmacs references since they
	are so old and no
	   longer maintained that no one uses them today.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Changed to enable right mouse
	key as Assist Key unless
	   optional argument MIDDLE-KEY-ONLY-FLAG is non-nil (which is how it is
	called from
	   hmouse-shifted-setup).

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-percentage-of-screen): Automatically
	adjusted out of bounds
	   percentages to the closest number of 0 and 0.998 (so does not
	overflow screen.
	   Automatically moved frame if right or bottom edges are offscreen as a
	result of size change.

	* DEMO (Dragging Buffers and Windows): Renamed this from 'Moving
	Buffers' and added subsections.

	2017-10-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Modeline Clicks): Renamed from Smart Key
	Modeline.  Added
	   up-to-date info on click locations and actions.
			    (Implicit Buttons): Added git-reference,
	git-commit-reference and
	   github-reference.
			    (Future Work): Added Direct Manipulation section.
		     (Smart Keys): Moved before Buttons chapter since Buttons
	references
	   Smart Keys and the benefits of Smart Keys are quicker to understand.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired, smart-dired-assist): Made end of first line
	behave just like
	   last line for quitting and executing actions.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Further
	optimized for when
	   depress and release windows are the same and frame has an auto-raise
	property, then we
	   know release window was uppermost at the point of release and can
	skip finding what app
	   owned the topmost window.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-dired-readin-hook):
		       (hmouse-dired-display-here-mode): Added and used in
	hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms.
	   Once a dired buffer item has been dragged, make next Action Key press
	on an item display it
	   in the same dired window.
	 man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Dired Mode): Documented here and in
	smart-dired function.

	* man/hkey-help.txt:
	 hui-window.el: Updated drag acton summaries with the latest
	information.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-vertically-within-emacs): Added to allow
	for modeline vertical drags
	   between windows.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired-pathname-up-to-point): Added this to change
	the behavior of smart-dired.
	   When on the first line of a Dired buffer where its directory path is
	shown, treat any ancestor
	   subdirectory of the current directory as a selectable path.	Thus,
	you can run Dired on any
	   ancestor subdirectory simply by pressing the Action Key at the end of
	the subdirectory you want.
	   A press on the first / character, runs dired on the root directory.
	 man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Dired Mode): Updated doc to reflect
	this change.

2017-10-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added modeline drag to window to replace dest. buffer with source
	buffer; showed Hyperbole key bindings in menu

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-between-frames): Removed from hmouse-alist;
	treat this context
	   the same as a drag between windows within one frame, for consistency.

	* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Added for use as menu filter for
	Hyperbole/Options/Change-Key-Bindings
	   so displayed key bindings are always up-to-date.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-outline-level): Added and used instead of
	(outline-level) which assumes
	   its caller has already generated match data, which is not always the
	case in Hyperbole.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-move-point-emacs): Added
	mouse-select-region-move-to-beginning handling
	   that appeared in Emacs 26.1 and noted this in the function
	documentation.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-buffer-to-window): Added along with drag from
	mode-line to another
	   window context to replace the buffer in a dest. window with the
	buffer from the source
	   window.

2017-10-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added 'topwin' Python script to determine topmost app window at a screen
	position under macOS.

2017-10-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added drags between frames and outside Emacs, new mode-line drags, dired
	item drags,
	 hyperbole.el commentary, texinfo @findex and @vindex implicit buttons,
	hycontrol
	 frame quadrant movement by virtual numeric keypad, greater hycontrol
	WINDOW/FRAME
	 commonality, hycontrol rapid frame percentage resizing along a single
	edge, improved
	 smart key help

	2017-10-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-query:at-p): eliminated match of #id-number
	and always required
	  'bug' or similar prefix so there is no ambiguity with social
	references including
	  git #commit-number.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Updated to handle call-interactively
	actions and 'or'ed action
	   intelligently when printing action documentation.

	2017-10-15  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (action-key-depress-position,
	assist-key-depress-position): Added to
	   test whether or not last Action Mouse Key event was a mouse click
	(non-drag event).

	2017-10-14  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Added
	optional Python script,
	   topwin, for macOS window-system only.  It determines the topmost
	application window at
	   the given position and returns the application name, so Emacs can
	tell if its frame is
	   obscured by another application or not.
		       (hmouse-verify-release-window-flag): Added so can turn
	off use of the macOS
	   Python script when desired since it slows Smart Key action handling
	at least 1/3 of a
	   second.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frames): Changed = command call to
	set-frame-size to use pixel
	   dimensions rather than chars/lines for better accuracy.
	   (hycontrol-window-to-new-frame): Same.

	* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-binding-item): Added.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-set-point): Fixed to return a posn object as a
	fallback, i.e. what
	   event-start and event-end return; previously, had returned point as a
	marker in this case.
	   Keyboard-based emulation of mouse drags via hkey-operate had been
	broken; this fixed it.
	* hui-window.el (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Updated to accept a
	posn.
		       (hmouse-modeline-event-p): Ignored case where args is a
	posn or point-marker,
	   not an event.

	2017-10-13  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term): Emacs set-frame-parameter does
	not return the value, so
	   this function was always returning nil.  Fixed it to return what the
	doc says it does.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-at-left-p, hycontrol-frame-at-top-p,
	hycontrol-frame-at-right-p,
	   hycontrol-frame-at-bottom-p): Added.
	   (hycontrol-frame-expand-to-*): Rewrote these: first they expand a
	frame to a particular edge;
	     then the next invocation when already at that edge, cuts that frame
	dimension in half from the
	     opposite side (or to any percentage specified as an argument),
	leaving the particular edge fixed.
	     Renamed to hycontrol-frame-resize-to-*.  This allows both rapid
	expansion and contraction of
	     frames with just 4 keys whenever needed.
	   (hycontrol-frame-resize-percentage, hycontrol-frame-resize-arg):
	Added as support functions.
	   (hycontrol-frame-edges): Added to ensure outer edges of frames are
	always used.
	   (hycontrol-frames): Added arg as a 0-100 percentage for i,j,k,m
	commands.
	   (hycontrol-windows): Added same c (cycle frame positions), i,j,k,m
	keys and numeric
	      keypad keys to here.
	   (hycontrol-frames/windows): Added p (virtual numeric keypad) to allow
	keyboard-based frame
	      quadrant movement when a numeric keypad is not available.	 This
	can be interrupted
	      with a q to return to the control menu or a C-g to abort the
	control menu.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-horizontal-action-drag): Replaced doc typo of
	'vertical' with 'horizontal'.

	* DEMO (Help buffers): Added description of how to get help for Smart
	Mouse Key-only events.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows, hycontrol-frames): In window-control
	mode, changed {f}
	   to clone window to new frame without deleting the source window to
	match similar
	   Action Key drag from window/modeline to outside of any Emacs window. 
	Added {F} to clone but
	   delete the source window.  Added these 2 bindings to frame-control
	mode too.  Documented
	   in Hyperbole manual.

	    Expanded control help to 4 lines, added = command to equalize sizes
	of windows/frames,
	   added f/F commands.

	* hibtypes.el (texinfo-ref): Added doc display for Emacs Lisp @findex
	(function) and @vindex
	  (variable) entries.  Changed so does nothing if function or variable
	is unbound.
	  Updated its doc string and doc in the Hyperbole manual.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Changed to print "WHICH WILL:" rather than
	"WHICH:" when the first
	   word of the doc string does not end in an 's', e.g. "Display this"
	instead of "Displays this".

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-release-left-edge): Noted that left edge
	mode-line clicks must be on the
	   first blank character of the mode-line because Emacs overrides the
	Smart Mouse Key bindings
	   immediately after that position.  Noted in Hyperbole manual as well.

	* Makefile (version): Added hyperbole.el to version check.
	 hyperbole.el: Updated the Commentary with a description of Hyperbole in
	case the Emacs package
	   system or a user looks here for it.

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-clone-window-to-new-frame): Added and used in
	hmouse-alist.

	2017-10-12  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-to-frame): Renamed to
	hycontrol-window-to-new-frame.
		      (hycontrol-keep-window-flag): Added: When non-nil (default
	is nil), leave
	   original window when tear off window to another frame.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-emacs-modeline-event-p,
	hmouse-modeline-event-p): Added.
	   (hmouse-modeline-depress, hmouse-modeline-release): Simplified and
	speeded up for GNU Emacs.
	   (action-key-modeline, assist-key-modeline):
	 man/hyperbole.texi (Modeline Clicks and Drags): Updated with new
	modeline buffer id click actions.
	 man/hkey-help.txt: Updated with most new drag and click actions.

	* hywconfig.el: Changed all (called-interactively-p 'interactive) to
	(called-interactively-p)
	   so will work if called interactively from one of the Smart Key lists.

	* DEMO: Fixed a number of small issues with implicit buttons therein.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-diagonally, hmouse-drag-horizontally,
	hmouse-drag-vertically):
	   Added explicit test that press and release are in the same window.
	   (hmouse-drag-item-to-display, hmouse-item-to-window): Added dired
	support.
	   (hmouse-pulse-flag): Disabled by default due to sluggishness and
	improper visuals at times.
	   (hmouse-map-modes-to-form, hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms): Added.
	   (hmouse-drag-item-to-display, hmouse-item-to-window): Updated to use
	the new variable,
	      hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms so users can add new modes for named
	item drags.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-between-frames): Added and used in
	hmouse-alist.
		       (hmouse-alist): Added modeline drags between frames and
	outside of Emacs.
	   Added window drags outside of any window (outside of Emacs).
		       (hmouse-clone-window-to-frame): Added and used in
	hmouse-alist.
	 man/hkey-help.txt: Updated with latest modeline and between window drag
	movements.

	2017-10-11  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-to-frame): Modified in the case of only
	one window in the frame,
	   then clone the window into a new frame.  This allows you to create a
	bunch of tiled frames
	   when in Window Control mode.	 Also made this an autoload and called
	in "hui-window" within
	   hmouse-alist.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows): Added to handle the
	case where a drag release is
	   outside of any Emacs window or frame and used in hmouse-alist.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-vertical-line-spacing): Added and used to
	compute vertical character positions.
		       (hmouse-key-release-window-emacs): Renamed to
	hmouse-key-release-window and used in
	   hmouse-function to set action/assist-key-release-window accurately.
		       (hmouse-function): Fixed so
	action/assist-key-release-prev-point is set properly,
	   before point is set to the location of the mouse button release.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-thing): Fixed to handle when release
	location is outside Emacs and
	   end-point is nil.
		       (hmouse-drag-same-window): Added and used in horizontal
	and vertical drag tests.

	* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-update-smart-keys): Extended to also
	re-initialize Smart Key bindings.

	* hmouse-drv.el (smart-scroll-up): Removed 's' from the end of verbs in
	all function comments,
	  e.g. scroll window instead of scrolls window, for consistency within
	the file.
	  (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position, hmouse-window-coordinates):
	Added to compute the
	     actual window and location of the release of a mouse drag which
	Emacs does not compute.
	     Proper top-to-bottom listing of frames is available only in Emacs
	26 and above.  For
	     prior versions, the ordering of the frames returned is not
	guaranteed, so the frame
	     whose window is returned may not be the uppermost.

	   (hmouse-key-release-window-emacs, hmouse-key-release-args-emacs):
	Updated to use new window
	     of release functions.  Now drags between frames work properly.

2017-10-11  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added gh#status to show github status; eliminated annot-bib matches from
	programming modes.

	2017-10-10  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hyperbole.el (after-init-time): Add hyperb:init to the end of
	after-init-hook;
	  previously was added at the beginning.  This is intended to ensure
	that Hyperbole
	  key bindings are set after any others, notably {M-RET}.

	* hypb.el (hypb:rgrep-command): Changed to zgrep when available to
	handle compressed source files.

	2017-10-09  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Eliminated matches for any programming mode
	(modes derived from `prog-mode').

	* README.md: Fixed link markup in Mailing Lists and Ftp and Git Source
	Code-only Downloads

	2017-10-08  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Re-arranged types to reflect
	newest prioritization.

	* hib-social.el (github-reference): Added support for showing status of
	Github services
	   with gh#status.

	2017-10-06  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Hiding and Showing): Added paragraph on using {C-x
	4 c} to clone
	   a Koutline and display multiple views of it.	 But commented this out
	because of an
	   Emacs bug which alters the narrowing of indirect buffers after an
	outline hide or show.

2017-10-06  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	V6.0.2d - Improved README and added git#=branch:file implicit button
	syntax.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2d and rebuilt output
	formats.

	* Makefile (README.md.html): Added build rule as part of 'make doc'.
	 README*: Rewrote the Summary intro paragraph and first two numbered
	items in simpler terms
	   for new users.

	* hib-social.el (git-commit-reference): Added new implicit button type
	to display a diff for
	   any commit listed in 'git log' output.
		       (git-reference): Fixed a few typos and added support for
	git#=branch:file syntax
	   to view (not edit) a file from a specific branch.  Hyperbole finds
	which project the branch
	   and file are associated with if a default is not specified. 
	Documented in this file and DEMO.

2017-10-05  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added new git-find-file command and associated git#=file implicit button
	type.

	* hib-social.el (hibtypes-git-build-repos-cache): Fixed to prune matches
	like 'file-git',
	   leaving just .git parent directories.
		       (hibtypes-git-find-execute, hibtypes-git-find,
	git-find-file): Added
	   to locate and edit any git-versioned filename.
		       (hibtypes-social-regexp, git-reference): Updated with
	git#=file syntax
	   to find git-versioned files by name.
	 DEMO (Git (Local) References): Added example of new git#=file implicit
	button.

2017-10-04  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	V6.0.2c - Smart Key and popup menu buffer fixes; simplified Assist Key
	handling code

	2017-10-04  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2c and rebuilt output
	formats.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-bind-key): Renamed to hmouse-bind-key-emacs since
	is emacs-only.
		      (hmouse-bind-shifted-key): Renamed to
	hmouse-bind-shifted-key-emacs.

	2017-10-03  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): In hmouse-drag-horizontally test,
	removed check of
	  (not (hmouse-drag-between-windows)) since was tested earlier in
	hmouse-alist.
		       (hmouse-resize-window-side, hmouse-release-left-edge,
			hmouse-swap-buffers, hmouse-swap-windows,
			hmouse-modeline-resize-window,
	hmouse-release-right-edge,
			hmouse-modeline-click, hmouse-modeline-release): Removed
	optional
	   assist-flag arg; used assist-flag free variable instead.

	* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Fixed to include tags-table found
	in any
	   ancestor directory of current directory when tags-table-list already
	   contains items.

	* hpath.el (hpath:find-program): Changed so Hyperbole external and
	internal
	   file suffix lists are consulted before using standard directory or
	   image display methods.  So for example, Emacs.app on macOS, which is
	actually
	   a directory, can be displayed/run externally.
		  (hpath:external-display-alist-macos): Added .app suffix.

	* hui-jmenu.el (hui-menu-buffer-mode-name): mode-name might not be a
	string; pass it through
	   format-mode-line to ensure it is a string.  Without this,
	hui-menu-of-buffers could
	   trigger an error on some buffers.

2017-10-02  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added hmouse-pulse-flag and more pulsing; fixed many small internal
	Hyperbole button handling functions. Replicated hui:link-directly user
	message for use whenever ebuttons are interactively created or modified.

	2017-10-02  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-pulse-flag): Added to allow disabling visual
	pulsing in Action Mouse
	   Key buffer/file window placement.  Used in hmouse-pulse-buffer and
	hmsoue-pulse-line.

	* hload-path.el (stringp): Forced use of hyperb:dir truename (after
	resolving pathname links).

	* hbdata.el (hbdata:build): Modified to ensure that but-sym or
	hbut:current (if but-sym is nil)
	   is updated with all modified button attributes.  This is used after
	interactive explicit
	   button creation or modification to display current attributes.

	* hui.el (hui:ebut-operate): Removed as this was obsoleted long ago; use
	ebut:operate instead.

	* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Updated documentation to clarify that this
	modified button properties,
	   notably its action's argument list.
	 hbut.el (hattr:copy, hattr:set):
	 hpath.el (hpath:substitute-var): Clarified documentation.

	* hui.el (hui:ebut-message): Added message for use when creating and
	modifying explicit buttons.
		(hui:ebut-create, hui:ebut-modify): Called hui:ebut-message
	after interactively creating
	   or modifying an explicit button (just as hui:link-directly already
	did).
		(hui:link-directly): Modified to call hui:ebut-message.

	* hact.el (actype:param-list): Added.
	 hui.el (hui:action): Fixed to handle parameter lists with keywords such
	as &optional.

	* hactypes.el (link-to-file): When modifying a link, changed to handle a
	variable in the pathname
	   and also to maintain any prior in-file location as a default when
	prompting for changes even
	   if the linked-to file is not yet loaded in a buffer.

	* hact.el (action:params-emacs): Added to use doc strings and autoload
	functions to get calling
	   signatures for Emacs25 byte-coded functions.	 Previously, functions
	with bit-coded integer
	   argument parameter placeholders were not supported.
		 (action:params): Called action:params-emacs on byte-coded
	objects.  Also, rewrote
	   to handle indirect byte-coded actions as well.

	2017-10-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-item-to-window): When drag from fixed menu
	header line, pulse the menu
	   buffer and move the menu buffer itself to the drag release window.

2017-10-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	V6.0.2b; Fixed ebut creation argument prompting; Normal key seqs and ESC
	for meta allowed in HyControl

	2017-10-01  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-handle-event):
		      (hycontrol-prettify-event): Fixed to handle large integer
	code events, e.g. M-p.

	2017-09-30  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* man/hyperbole.texi (HyControl):
	 hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Removed ESC as a
	quit command since now that
	   key sequences are supported, this is often used as a meta key prefix.
	 Use {q} to quit.

	* hact.el (actype:act, actype:action): Fixed regexp match to beginning
	of string; quote mark used
	  had somehow been changed to the end of string match regexp.  As a
	result, when explicit
	  buttons were being created or modified, no arguments were prompted
	for.

	* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Removed unneeded properties from any
	returned string.

	* hpath.el (hpath:at-p): Added missing non-exist parameter to
	hpath:delimited-possible-path call.
	   This extends the prior bug fix for hpath:at-p.  See below.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-key-release-args-emacs): Updated to handle
	cross-frame drags properly
	   for when Emacs' event system is fixed to return the proper frame for
	a cross-frame drag
	   release event (as of 25.3, it returns the depress frame rather than
	the release frame).

	2017-09-29  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-prettify-event): Added.

	2017-09-28  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-handle-event): Expanded to handle single
	non-self-inserting
	   keys and key sequences.

2017-09-28  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Minor bug fixes for Koutlines; updated Hyperbole manual version
	* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.02a and rebuilt output
	formats.

	* man/hyperbole.texi (View Specs): Noted that ellipses can no longer be
	   turned off.
	 kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:compute): Removed `e' ellipses viewspec because
	   it no longer works with modern Emacs outlining.
			(kvspec:update): Force display of `e' viewspec.
			(kvspec:activate): Changed to always compute new
	kvspec:current
	   even if requested view-spec seems the same so the 'e' viespec is
	added if
	   not included.

	* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Handled removal of newest
	   outline-minor-mode mode-line indication for Koutlines.

2017-09-28  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Supported Emacs button mouse action; improved Lisp outlining support;
	improved load library links

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-push-button-help): Added 2nd optional arg,
	use-mouse-action,
	   which if non-nil, displays help for mouse-action property if any, and
	falls
	   back to action property otherwise.
		      (hkey-alist): push-button - Changed to use mouse-action if
	   last-command-event was a mouse event.  Previously, mouse actions were
	    not supported.

	* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Changed to not match anywhere on
	the first
	   line of def constructs.  This aids in using Smart Keys for outline
	   folding within Lisp buffers.
		       (smart-lisp-at-definition-p): Added to test if point is
	on
	   the first line of a non-alias Lisp definition.
		       (smart-lisp-at-load-expression-p): Added to test if point
	   is on any type of Lisp library load expression.
		       (smart-lisp): Changed call of
	buffer-substring-no-properties
	   to match-string-no-properties.
		       (smart-lisp): Fixed regexp matching of require and
	autoload expressions.
	      For require and load, moved point to start of the buffer.
	      For autoload, triggered an error if library is found but symbol
	def is not.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-outline-char-invisible-p): Substituted
	outline-invisible-p
	   call for kproperty:get, which may not yet be defined.
		      (smart-outline-subtree-hidden-p): Fixed to match only when
	point is
	   on a heading.
		      (smart-imenu-item-at-p): Updated to ignore when
	smart-lisp-at-definition-p
	   or smart-lisp-at-load-expression-p tests are true.
		      (hkey-alist): smart-imenu - ignored non-alias identifiers
	on the
	   first line of a Lisp def.

2017-09-27  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Made Action Key display selected buffer menu item in the same window as
	the buffer menu.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-buffer-menu-no-marks): Added and called in
	smart-buffer-menu.
		      (smart-ibuffer-menu-no-marks): Added and called in
	smart-ibuffer-menu.
	   Makes Action Key display the selected buffer in the buffer menu
	window (like RET does)
	   rather than restoring previous window configuration and then
	displaying buffer.  This
	   works better with the new buffer item drag to display in a window
	feature.

2017-09-27  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Added brief pulsing/flashing from source line to line in destination
	buffer.
	* hui-window.el (pulse): Added require for momentary highlighting of
	buffer/file
	   item lines.
		       (hmouse-pulse-line): Added.
		       (hmouse-item-to-window): Added pulses to source and dest.
	lines.

2017-09-26  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	V6.0.2a; Action Key drag from buffer, file and helm buffer item menus to
	another window to display.

	* hmouse-drv.el (action-key-depress): Added action-key-depress-hook.
		       (assist-key-depress): Added assist-key-depress-hook.
		(action-mouse-key):   Added action-key-release-hook.
		(assist-mouse-key):   Added assist-key-release-hook.
		       (action-key): Added action-key-depress/release-hook.
		(assist-key): Added assist-key-depress/release-hook.
	 hui-window.el (action-key-depress-hook): Set to select helm items
	   prior to a drag outside the helm buffer window.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-line-has-action): Fixed to use position of
	   Action Key depress; this properly selects the item chosen, even when
	   a cross-window drag is used; this allows helm buffer and file items
	to
	   be used in Hyperbole drag actions.

	* hib-social.el (github-reference): Added support for
	   gh#orgs/<org-name>/people query to list users in an org.

	* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-depress-inactive-minibuffer-p): Improved doc and
	   changed param name to `event'.
		       (action-key-depress-window, assist-key-depress-window):
	   Improved doc.

	* hui-window.el (smart-coords-in-window-p, smart-window-of-coords,
			hmouse-inactive-minibuffer-p):
	 hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-depress-inactive-minibuffer-p):
	 hargs.el (hargs:select-event-window): Updated to handle multiple frames
	and minibuffers.

	* hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): Extended hmouse-drag-between-windows to
	   allow dragging items from a buffer menu or file menu buffer to a
	destination
	   window for display.	Helm buffer items are supported as well.
		       (hmouse-item-to-window, hmouse-drag-buffer-to-window):
	Added.
	 hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-to-minibuffer): Added to encapsulate when to
	   return to minibuffer, and called.

	* hversion.el (hyperb:version): Start adding a letter at the end of the
	version number for
	   significant pre-releases published to git, so we know which version
	is in use.

2017-09-25  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	File/Dir linking fix; Smart Key reloading; helm mouse control
	improvements; Hyperbole menu use doc strings
	* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-item): Improved so that if menu item has no help
	string but its action is a
	   function with a doc string, then it will use the first line of the
	action doc string for displaying
	   help on the item.

	* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-check-action-key, hmouse-check-assist-key):
	Added to check that both depress
	   and release events are set to Smart Mouse Keys.  Mainly for use with
	helm.  Called from smart-helm
	   and smart-helm-assist respectively.

	* hui-mouse.el (action-key-error, assist-key-error): Maded explicit
	these are messages from Hyperbole.
		      (smart-helm-at-header): Corrected doc string.
	       (smart-helm-at): Added to test type of helm thing point is at.
	       (smart-helm, smart-helm-assist): Updated to complement each other
	better; made section header
	   clicks work.

	* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-add-unshifted-smart-keys): Renamed from
	hmouse-add-unshifted-keys.
	   Made interactive and added error if invoked under something other
	than GNU Emacs 19 or higher.
		       (hmouse-update-smart-keys): Added to provide interactive
	updating of Smart Keys
	     whenever a matching context or action has been changed in the
	source code; reloads any
	     changes to "hui-mouse", "hui-window", "hibtypes" or "hactypes",
	most notably changes to
	     hkey-alist and hmouse-alist.

	* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist, smart-outline-char-invisible-p, smart-eolp):
	   Added and used to improve and narrow matching of end-of-lines. 
	Previously, did not handle
	   new-style Emacs outlines properly nor helm section header lines.

	* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:action-key, kotl-mode:assist-key):
	 hui-mouse.el (smart-outline, smart-outline-assist): Changed to invoke
	action/assist-key-eol-function
	   for end-of-line scrolling, eliminating hard-coded call.
	 man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Emacs Outline Mode): Documented this
	change.

	* hargs.el (hargs:at-p): Fixed bug when linking to files or directories,
	would choose
	   symbol at Action Key release point rather than the file or directory
	containing
	   that symbol.	 This was caused by allowing matches to non-existent
	files and dirs
	   when the 'no-default' argument was t.  Now prevented such matching. 
	This could
	   occur when creating or editing explicit button links.

2017-09-24  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	hib-social.el: When a git-reference is activated, trigger an error if
	`locate' command is not found.

2017-09-23  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	hib-debbugs.el: Removed dependency on package.el which some people don't
	want/need loaded.
	* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-version-sufficient-p): Added to eliminate use
	of version testing
	   function from package.el which some people prefer not to load.

2017-09-22  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Speeded up search for and addition of a single git project to the dir
	cache.
	* hib-social.el (hibtypes-git-add-project-to-repos-cache)
		       (hibtypes-git-build-or-add-to-repos-cache): Added to
	allow
	   for adding a single new project to the cache.

2017-09-22  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Add git and github reference support for branches, issues, pull requests
	and tags.

	2017-09-22  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hact.el (actype:act): Expand arguments as pathnames only in functions
	   defined with defact (actions may be regular defuns as well).

	* hib-social.el (github-reference): Added support for listing all active
	or showing
	   individual branches, issues, pull requests and commit tags.	See the
	   doc string for this function and the examples in the file commentary.
		       (git-reference): Added support for listing all active or
	showing
	   individual branches and commit tags.	 See the doc string for this
	function and
	   the examples in the file commentary.
		       (defact*): Changed all these to regular functions to
	   prevent Hyperbole from trying to expand their arguments as pathnames.

	2017-09-21  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm): Added: On a source section header, moves to
	the next source
	   section or first if on last.	 But this doesn't yet work properly
	(helm is scrolling
	   the buffer and not leaving point in the proper location).

	* hui-mini.el (hyperbole): Removed interactive use of prefix argument to
	set doc-flag and
	   help-string-flag parameters since this didn't interactively display
	doc.  Instead,
	   this change lets the prefix arg flow through to any menu commands
	that can use it.

	* hib-social.el: Added full Commentary with implicit link examples.

2017-09-20  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* DEMO (Git References): Added.
	 hib-social.el (hibtypes-github-default-project): Renamed from
	hibtypes-social-github-default-project.
		       (hibtypes-github-default-user): Renamed from
	hibtypes-social-githbu-default-user.
		(hibtypes-git-default-project): Added.
		(hibtypes-git-*, git-reference): Updated to allow
	   git#project/commit-hashtag references.  So now all of the
	   following are recognized as local git references if the default
	   project setting is set up:
	     git#hyperbole/5ae3550    (project name and commit hashtag can be
	given; commit diff displayed)
	     gt#5ae3550		      (project default is used; commit diff
	displayed)
	     gt#/hyperbole	      (project home directory is displayed)
		       (github-reference): Renamed from github-commit-reference.
	 Also added support for syntax:
	     gh#/hyperbole	      (project home directory is displayed; uses
	default user setting)
	     gh#/rswgnu/hyperbole     (project home directory is displayed)

	    Requires GNU locate for finding all local git repositories.

	* hibtypes.el (grep-msg): Added match to context lines produced by 'grep
	-A<num>'
	   which use '-' around the line number rather than ':'.
	   (hib-debbugs): Lowered priority below hib-social so it doesn't shadow
	valid
	      social references since it matching is broad.

	* hib-social.el (social-reference, hibtypes-social-regexp): Added
	missing '-'
	   character in social-reference matches.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-image-dired-thumbnail,
	smart-image-dired-thumbnail-assist):
	   Added to support browsing of directories of images via thumbnails.
	   Action Key displays a scaled version of the original image in an
	Emacs window.
	   Assist Key displays the original image in an external viewer.

2017-09-19  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hib-social.el (hibtypes-social-default-service): Changed to use a
	radio
	   button choice when customizing this.
		       (hibtypes-social-hashtag-alist,
	hibtypes-social-username-alist): Added
	   github user and commit lookup via social link syntax.
		       (hibtypes-social-github-default-user):
		       (hibtypes-social-github-default-project)
		       (github-commit-reference): Added this new action and its
	   above default values.
		       (hibtypes-social-regexp): Updated to allow
	   github#user/project/commit-hashtag references.  So now all of the
	   following are recognized as github commit links if the default user
	   and project settings are set up:
	     gh#rswgnu/hyperbole/5ae3550 (if include user must include project)
	     github#hyperbole/5ae3550	 (project can be given with user
	default)
	     gh#5ae3550			 (user and project defaults are used)

	    Additionally, gh@rswgnu can be used to jump to user rswgnu's github
	   home page.
	 DEMO (Github): Added to demonstrate github references.

	* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Moved in priority below social hashtags and
	   denied matching to anything containing a # or @ character so
	   [twitter@someuser] doesn't match as an annot-bib entry.

	* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added helm support for Smart Key presses in
	  the minibuffer window (runs the standard RET command).

2017-09-18  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Made smart-helm ignore helm candidate separator lines.

2017-09-18  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	Changes to hui-window.el had not been saved in prior commit.

2017-09-18  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	2017-09-18  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm): Finalized and added doc. of contexts and
	actions.

	* hui-window.el (smart-coords-in-window-p):
		       (hmouse-drag-window-side): Handled null value of coords.

	2017-09-17  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Changed minibuffer handling to support
	Helm.

	* man/hkey-help.txt: Small updates to Special Mode doc.

	* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-add-unshifted-keys): Added to allow user init
	   of unshifted Smart Keys.  For GNU Emacs only, this binds
	   [mouse-2] to the Action Key and [mouse-3] to the Assist Key.
	 man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Added doc for
	hmouse-add-unshifted-keys.

	* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-get-unshifted-bindings): Uncommented inclusion of
	  mouse-3 for times when user manually sets mouse-3 as the Assist Key.
	  Otherwise, hmouse-toggle-bindings will never change its value.
		      (hmouse-bind-key, hmouse-bind-shifted-key): Added and used
	  these to ensure depress and release bindings are wholly reset before
	  rebinding them under GNU Emacs.

	2017-09-14  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hpath.el (hpath:external-open-office-suffixes): Added .odt suffix.

	* hui-select.el (hui-select-at-p): Protect against empty buffer error.

	2017-09-12  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hibtypes.el (grep-msg):
		     (pathname): Don't match in helm completion buffers.

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-line-has-action): Ignore any actions helm
	   imputes to header lines and candidate separator lines in helm
	   completion buffers, as they are non-actionable lines.  Also, ignore
	   if at the end of the buffer.
		      (hkey-alist): Lowered smart-helm priority so can use Smart
	   Key end-of-line functions in such buffers.

	* hsys-www.el (eww-link-at-point): Basic stylistic improvements.

	2017-09-11  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	hyrolo.el: Added basic commentary to the file header.

2017-09-11  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	2017-09-10  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm, smart-helm-assist,
	smart-helm-line-has-action):
	 hsettings.el (helm-allow-mouse): Set to t.
	   New helm completion activation support.
	   Added to allow mouse direct selection of helm completion items.  The
	   smart-helm function behaves similarly to the {C-j} and {C-z} key
	bindings
	   that helm mode provides when a helm completion is active but the
	Smart
	   Keys work in the completions buffer regardless of whether a helm
	   completion is active or not.

	* hsys-www.el (www-url): Added Action and Assist Key support for
	browsing
	   links in eww (the Emacs web browser) and for activating history links
	   in the eww history buffer.

	2017-09-08  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hpath.el (hpath:url-regexp3): Added a third pattern match for URLs,
	  allowing for partial http urls with non-www site names preceded by the
	  literal url or URL followed by a : or =.  For example:
	  url:photos.google.com or url=calendar.google.com

	2017-09-07  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-browser): Changed the Default setting to always
	   use the current setting of browse-url-default-browser since that is
	the
	   default in browse-url (eliminated use of browse-url-generic).

	* hypb.el (hypb:decode-url): Added.
	 hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Fixed to handle and decode encoded URL paths
	before
	   returning the path.

	2017-09-06  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Changed Python predicate to match more 
	broadly, namely in any non-file buffer whose name includes Pydoc: or 
	Python (case-sensitive).

	* hmouse-tag.el (smart-python-at-tag-p): Expanded to handle tags with
	  periods embedded such as `sys.path'.

	2017-09-04  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hibtypes.el (debugger-source): Added support for Python pdb stack
	trace lines.

	2017-08-31  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hibtypes.el (pathname): Wrapped mode-name reference in
	format-mode-line
	   call since mode-name is not always a string.

	* hui-em-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Added to allow disabling of
	explicit button highlighting.
		       (hproperty:but-create-all):  Used this new flag.
	 hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Added to allow disabling of
	explicit button highlighting.
		       (hproperty:but-create-all):  Used this new flag.

	* hbut.el (ebut:map): Changed to ignore explicit button matches in
	   programming languages when outside of a comment.  For example, syntax
	like
	   this in a Rust buffer had been improperly matched: fn
	parse_kv(kv_list:
	   Vec<(syn::Ident, syn::StrLit)>, function: &Function) -> LispFnArgs

	2017-08-25  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hui-mouse.el (smart-ibuffer-menu): Ibuffer calling conventions have
	   changed across time (as of Emacs25) to allow for regional arguments;
	   updated to account for these.

	* hpath.el (hpath:remote-at-p): For Emacs 26 where
	   tramp-file-name-structure is now a function instead of a variable,
	call
	   the function.

	* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-kill): Triggered error if FILE contains a '*'
	character,
	   mainly in case a buffer name is passed as an argument.
		   (hyrolo-file-list-initialize): Added this function so can
	   re-initialize the hyrolo-file-list later if BBDB or Google Contacts
	   support is loaded after the Hyperbole Rolo is initialized.

	* hbut.el (hbut:source): Allowed for spaces in buffer names.

	* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-edit-entry): Avoided error if bbdb-file is nil.

	* hbut.el (ebut:label-p): Added one-line-flag to constrain label search
	to a single line.
	 hibtypes.el (Info-node): Constrained Info-node hyper-button matches to
	a single line.

	* hyrolo.el: Added support for Google Contacts when the google-contacts
	   package is in use and a public key package is available for Google
	   authorization.

	* man/hyperbole.texi: Documented Pages Directory Listing handling.

	Programming Identifier handling.

	 man/hkey-help.txt: Documented Pages Directory Listing and Imenu
	Programming Identifier handling.

2016-08-26  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Modified to invoke help-mode only if
	buffer name includes 'Help' to
	   support other specialized modes that use temp buffers.

	2016-08-25  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* README.md, README.md.html: Updated to match Hyperbole home page.

	this file may be shown prior to
	   download in the Emacs package manager.

	* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:label-html-font-attributes): Fixed improper
	'defvar' definition which should
	   have been a 'defcustom'.

	2016-08-16  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Fixed so C-M-<char> is normalized the
	same way as M-C-<char>.
		    (kbd-key:extended-command-prefix): Added.
		    (kbd-key, kbd-key:act): Added kbd-key:extended-command-p
	test and used in this implicit button
	   type and action type to support Action Key presses on M-x extended

	   these are included in the Hyperbole DEMO.

	2016-08-15  Bob Weiner	<rsw@gnu.org>

	* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-dir): Added support for environment
	variables including those with PATH
	   in their name (colon-separated paths) that should have been there.
	   Added call to hpath:exists-p to test path with hpath:suffixes added
	to fix bug where
	   "${load-path}/simple.el" did not resolve properly when the file was
	stored compressed
	   as simple.el.gz, for example.

	of
	   Open Office documents based on this new option.
		  (hpath:command-string): Quoted filename argument to allow

	   This fixed an issue when an external viewer such as `open' was called
	under OS X
	   and the filename to be opened contained spaces.

	* hyperbole.el (Maintainer): Changed back to single line so ELPA parses
	it correctly.

	* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-gnu-query:list):
	 hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key, Info-directory-list):

	   if not after-init-time.  Also forced a return value of nil.
	 hui-menu.el (hyperbole-menubar-menu): Changed so this always updates

	* README.md: Added menu images and screenshots for easy access.

	* hui-mouse.el (action-key-eol-function, assist-key-eol-function): Added

	   options to control what the Action and Assist Keys do at the end of a
	line.
