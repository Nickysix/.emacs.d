The main purpose of this folder is to drop here Emacs packages
that for some reason are not available via `package.el` repositories
(e.g. you might want some package available only on EmacsWiki).

Any code that you place here will be available via `require`.
Within Prelude's code you can refer to this folder via
`prelude-vendor-dir`.
