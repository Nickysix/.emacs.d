  Fit for other humans to tell me "hey, it's broken", and I can fix it.

  But Not Even Alpha.

** Who am I?
   I'm Jonnay! [[mn:1][file:./assets/images/burning-bunny-transparent.png]]

   I've been using Emacs since 2007.  I make [[http://www.jonnay.net][Music, Art and Video
   Blogs]].  I'm a front-end narwhal (a Canadian coder who can do UX
   and design as well).  Professionally I have used many
   languages‚Äîincluding P/LB‚Äîbut my favorite is Scheme, and my current
   is ruby.

** What is this? A starter kit for magicians.
  The Emagicians Starter Kit is a set of org-mode files that are
  automagikally tangled into Emacs Lisp on startup.

  I got tired of my old .emacs file and poorly maintained collection
  of extensions. It was working less and less well the more and more
  time went on and on.  

  But it's more than that.  It's a set of lessons learned, ramblings
  of a lisp fanatic, and something of a personal great work.

** Why?

  I Love the idea of the starter kits, but I found they made
  assumptions and just wasn't fit for what I needed.  I also have a
  bit of a "not-invented-here" problem.  It's minor and I cope pretty
  well. However with regards to emacs: (and to paraphrase Douglas
  McArther Shaftoe from the Neal Stephenson novel /Cryptonomicon/.)

  #+begin_quote
  This is my Emacs.  There are plenty like it, but this one is mine.
  #+end_quote

  Additionally, there is real value in people explaining their emacs
  setup, especially in easily digestible forms.

** How 

   Everything is in Org-Mode.  If you want to join in all the fun,
   there is an [[file:./Emagician-Install.org]] file that you can follow
   along with.  It will get you moving into basic configurations, all
   the way through testing the result before making the emagician
   starter kit your actual init file.
    
** When

   March 2012.  It got commited to a git repo later that year.

** Where
   In an airplane across the Atlantic I made the first version of the Emagicians Starter Kit.
    
* A note about tone
  
  If your primary tool, as both hobby and vocation is your text
  editor, does it not then follow that it is one of the fundamentally
  important things in your life?

  But then, would that not put it on the same footing as ones spirituality?

  What if ones spirituality is Militant Agnostic Zenarchic Discordianism?

  Then you would write an Emagicians Startup Kit full of tongue in
  cheek references to the western magickal tradition, and venerate Eris constantly.

  That's what.

* Dedication
 
  To My Wife:  Shell Arkell.  The most important person in my life,
  who outshines all other people, like the noon-day sun outshines the
  stars.

  üåû I Love you. üåû
