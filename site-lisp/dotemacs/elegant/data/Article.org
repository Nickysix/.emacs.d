While Emacs  proponents largely  agree that  it is   Fulfilling  this  requirement  in  a  more  static
the world’s greatest text  editor, it is almost as   language would have been difficult at best. One of
much    a   Lisp    machine   disguised    as   an   Lisp’s chief  characteristics is  its malleability
editor. Indeed,  one of its chief  appeals is that   through  its   uniform  syntax  and  the   use  of
it  is   programmable  via  its   own  programming   macros. This  has allowed  the language  to evolve
language.   Emacs Lisp  is a  Lisp in  the classic   much  more  rapidly  and  substantively  than  the
tradition.   In  this   article,  we  present  the   evolution of  its core  would suggest,  by letting

third-party  packages  providing  a  multitude  of   multiple-dispatch object  systems, legible regular
extensions.   Still, Emacs  Lisp  has evolved  and   expressions,     programmable     pattern-matching
continues  to do  so. Important  aspects of  Emacs   constructs,     generalized     variables,     and
Lisp have been shaped  by concrete requirements of   more.  Still, the  core has  also evolved,  albeit
the editor  it supports as well  as implementation   slowly.   Most notably,  it  acquired support  for
constraints.  These requirements led to the choice   lexical   scoping.The  timeline   of  Emacs   Lisp
