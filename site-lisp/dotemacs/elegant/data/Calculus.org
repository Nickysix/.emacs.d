*CHAPTER I.*                 /TO DELIVER YOU FROM THE PRELIMINARY TERRORS/.

The preliminary  terror, which  chokes off  most fifth-form  boys from
even attempting to  learn how to calculate, can be  abolished once for
all by simply stating what is the meaning–in common-sense terms–of the
two principal  symbols that are  used in calculating.   These dreadful
symbols are:

(1) *d* which merely means /“a little bit of.”/

  Thus *dx* means a little  bit of *x*;  or *du*  means a  little bit  of *u*.
Ordinary mathematicians think  it more polite to say  /“an element of,”/
instead of /“a little bit of.”/  Just  as you please.  But you will find
that  these  little  bits  (or  elements)  may  be  considered  to  be
indefinitely small.

(2) *∫* which is merely a long *S*, and may be called (if you like)
    /“the sum of.”/

  Thus *∫dx* means the sum of all the little bits of *x*; or *∫dt* means the
sum of  all the little bits  of *t*.  Ordinary mathematicians  call this
symbol /“the integral of.”/ Now any fool can see that if *x* is considered
as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called *dx*, if you
add them all  up together you get  the sum of all the  *dx*'s, (which is
the same  thing as the whole  of *x*). The word  /“integral”/ simply means
/“the whole.”/ If  you think of the  duration of time for  one hour, you
may (if you like)  think of it as cut up into  3600 little bits called
seconds.  The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one
hour.

  When you see an expression  that begins with this terrifying symbol,
you  will henceforth  know that  it is  put there  merely to  give you
instructions that you are now to perform the operation (if you can) of
totalling up  all the little  bits that  are indicated by  the symbols
that follow. That's all.
