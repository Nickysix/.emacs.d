# Creates an obnoxious alert that is good for important, but
# long-running processes that you want to know if they stop early. To
# use, simply append to a command line, as in:
#
#     command-one ; beep
#
# It also works in a series:
#
#     command-one && beep && command-two && beep
#
# Of course, in this second case, you'd want to give the 'beep' the
# name of the command, as in:
#
#     command-one && beep "The first" && command-two && beep "The second"
#
# This script, along with attempting to speak the exit message, can
# also use the `terminal-notifier' program (on later Mac versions
# after the demise of Growl), so you can specify both the command and
# details about the message with options. Of course, using the script
# this way is getting into the realm where this script is part of
# another script.
#
# This program is quite Mac specific, in that it expects the sounds
# files in a particular location as well as the existence of the
# `aplay' command, etc.

# If we don't specify the command name as an argument, we'll just call it:
COMMAND="The command"

# Default value for the audio depends on the success or failure
# of the previous command... and do we have Failure wave file.
