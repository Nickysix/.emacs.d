The following example may be useful is following along with how
breadcrumb drops would work. Keep in mind this works with marks
(crumbs) in different file buffers.

Breadcrumb marker D    (Line: 5 Pos: 181)
               ^
Breadcrumb marker B    (Line: 7 Pos: 225)
^
Breadcrumb marker F    (Line: 9 Pos: 287)
                  ^
Breadcrumb marker C    (Line: 11 Pos: 336)
     ^
Breadcrumb marker A    (Line: 13 Pos: 399)
                  ^
Breadcrumb marker E    (Line: 15 Pos: 446)
  ^

           (crumb-at 446 "The end of the fun.")))
