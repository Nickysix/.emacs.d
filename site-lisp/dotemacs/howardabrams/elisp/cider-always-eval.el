;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Extension to Cider to advice the `cider-eval-defun-at-point' so
;;  that after evaluating the function, it also evaluates a collection
;;  of expressions in another buffer, placing the results of each at
;;  the end of the line.
;;
;;  To use, simply run:
;;
;;     (require 'cider-always-eval)
;;
;;  Then start the buffer with:
;;
;;     M-x cider-create-expression-collection-buffer
;;
;;  In the buffer that shows up, write any expressions you want
;;  evaluated. Typically, these would be calling the function
;;  currently under development. Then, each time you evaluate a
;;  function using the `cider-eval-defun-at-point', the results will
;;  be displayed.
;;
;;  Trigger more by advising other functions:
;;
;;      (advice-add 'cider-eval-region :after #'cider-eval-expression-collection)
;;
;;  Note: Do NOT advice `cider-eval-last-sexp' as that is being used
;;  for evaluation. Need to change that.
;;
;;
;;  The Backstory: Frank and I were at the PDX Emacs Hackers meetup,
;;  and he mentioned that he liked this feature in Lighttable, where
;;  you could set up a buffer of expressions, and then when you
;;  modified the function, it would re-evaluate them automatically.
;;
;;  So, without actually seeing Light Table do this, I figured I would
;;  build something similar. This is really a preliminary stab at the
;;  process, as the code calls `cider-eval-last-sexp', but it really
;;  should be calling `cider-interactive-eval'.
