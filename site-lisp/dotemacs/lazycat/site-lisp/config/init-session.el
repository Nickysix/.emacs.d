;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Init for session save/restore
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put init-session.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'init-session)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET init-session RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/06/20
;;      * Make `desktop.el' don't ask user if found file locked by other emacs process.
;;
;; 2018/06/14
;;      * Use `desktop.el' instead window.el and revive.el, those two libraries buggy.
;;      * Move `kill-unused-buffers' to package `basic-tookit.el'
;;
;; 2013/12/28
;;      * First released.
