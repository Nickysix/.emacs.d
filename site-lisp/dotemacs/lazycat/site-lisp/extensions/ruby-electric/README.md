* handling of strings of type 'here document'
* more keywords, with special handling for `do`
* packaged into a minor mode
* inserting matching pair delimiters like `{`, `[`, `(`, `'`, `"`, `'` and `|`
* added basic custom support for configuring keywords with electric closing and characters for which matching expansion should occur
