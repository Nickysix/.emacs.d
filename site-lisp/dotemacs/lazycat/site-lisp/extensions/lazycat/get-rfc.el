;;; Commentary:
;; This is a tiny little package to alleviate the pain of having to
;; switch out of Emacs if you want to view an RFC.
;; It prompts you for a RFC number and pops up a new buffer with said RFC.
;; You can specify whether you want to find RFCs locally or on the
;; internet, in either case the RFC is still opened in Emacs.
;;
;; Note, you need a working wget type program to get a remote RFC and
;; view it in Emacs.  If you don't have one, set the variable
;; `get-rfc-no-wget' to t (in this case, a browser will be opened up
;; to view the RFC.)
;;
;; If you do view RFCs in Emacs, rfcview.el is a useful package that
;; formats them nicely, available at
;; <URL:http://www.neilvandyke.org/rfcview/rfcview.el>
;;
;; Two commands are provided:
;; `get-rfc-view-rfc' -- Prompts for an RFC number and then displays
;;                       it in a new frame.
;; `get-rfc-view-rfc-at-point' -- Displays the RFC number at point in
;;                                a new frame.
;; `get-rfc-grep-rfc-index' -- Greps for the occurrence of a string in
;;                             the file rfc-index.txt.
;;
;; To use this file, place it somewhere in your load path, and then
;; add the following to your .emacs
;; (autoload 'get-rfc-view-rfc "get-rfc" "Get and view an RFC" t nil)
;; (autoload 'get-rfc-view-rfc-at-point "get-rfc" "View the RFC at point" t nil)
;; (autoload 'get-rfc-grep-rfc-index "get-rfc" "Grep rfc-index.txt" t nil)
;; You can then bind these functions to a key.
